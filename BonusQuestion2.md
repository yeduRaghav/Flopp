#### Flopp has been so successful that we have decided to expand from just a single industry to dozens of industries with dozens of apps (that are functionally the same). How would you recommend the company proceed with its development?

There are two approaches.

1. A single White-labeled app
2. Separate apps with individual codebases but shared components through libraries

As long as the app will remain functionally the same, the first approach is the better choice. This way, it is easy to build and maintain since it is all in one place.

The way to do this is Android is to leverage Gradle Build flavors.
A multi-modular codebase is also recommended. A module for each layer of the app.

This way each app(flavor) can have its own implementation of a module that needs to vary from the main set. Eg: Certain app flavors require the network implementation to be completely different, in that case, just the network module for that set can be changed.
For better scalability, the implementational details of each variant of a module can even be maintained as a separate repository. 

This approach also requires strict adherence to decoupling between entities, and unidirectional dependency flow. Interface/Contract-based programming is critical achieve this. Contract-based interaction and dependency definition must not be just between modules, but also entities within the same module. 

A composition based development attitude should be encouraged over inheritance-based (effective Java #16).
As the size and complexity grow it is not too long before the cyclomatic complexity gets out of control, and inheritance doesn't help. 

Due to the probability of variance in behavior and output, test coverage is crucial, and if possible TDD approach should be adopted. 
Additionally, extensive documentation, at least for any open or public functions and classes is necessary.

Beside all the above recommendations for the Android development team, it must be highlighted that this is a full company effort, it WON'T work otherwise. Everyone involved with the product must be educated about the pros and cons of white-label solution.

While Android provides a decent approach for this, the iOS and Web teams must also be brought into the discussion and understand how they too can adopt a similar approach. It is always better to tackle similar problems rather than every team fighting a different battle.
If the other teams cannot implement a similar approach the disparity between various platforms' ability to deliver and scale will be too high
and subsequently, affect the product and the organization as a whole.

Last but far from least, the UX/Product designers must be on the same page. 
They must understand the functional similarity of the product variants at every level beyond the superficial differences and they must design while labeled solutions. If not, it will be death by thousand cuts, as each app variant might introduce a "simple" or "small" feature that does not exist in other variants and before we know it, each variant is a different app. 
After all, engineers just build what's in the designer's blueprint.
